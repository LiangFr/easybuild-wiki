## Topics

Attendees are free to work on what they want, but a couple of topics of interest are typically attached to each hackathon. The intention is to have discussions on these topics, and that some attendees work on these issues:

* improve integration between Lmod and EasyBuild (Robert, the main/only Lmod developer will be there too)
* how we can further improve/automate the testing of EasyBuild (ad incoming PRs)
* getting rid of Python 2.4 support, moving on to Python 2.6, supporting Python 3.x
* outlook to EasyBuild v2.0: getting rid of deprecated behavior
  * no more Python 2.4 support (move on to only Python 2.6 or more recent 2.x)
  * no more old-style configuration files
  * extra_options return type (should be dict instead of list of tuples)
