This short guide will explain how to install the environment modules software package without root permissions, together with Tcl on which it depends.

### Tcl

1. Go to [[http://www.tcl.tk]] and download the latest Tcl sources. At the time of writing, the latest available Tcl version was 8.5.13, which can be downloaded [[here|http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/tcl8.5.13-src.tar.gz]].

2. Unpack the Tcl source tarball:

```bash
tar xfvz tcl8.5.13-src.tar.gz
```
