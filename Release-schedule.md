This page gives a overview of previous and future EasyBuild releases, along with details on the planning of future releases.

## Next release

(Preliminary) release schedule for **EasyBuild v1.6**:

* _feature freeze_: Mon. July 1st 2013 (9am)
* _planned release_: Wed July 10th 2013

Note: there will be no release end of July 2013 due to summer holidays. EasyBuild v1.7 is now roughly planned for end of August 2013.

## Release planning

### Release early, release often

We target monthly releases of EasyBuild, following a "release early, release often" strategy.
New releases are usually done on the last day of the month (or one of the first days of the next month).

### Feature freeze

For every release, we try to stick to a strict schedule to try and make sure we can release "in time".

The week before a planned release, we set a _feature freeze_ deadline. Only pull requests that are open before that deadline are considered for inclusion in the next release.

Between the feature freeze and the planned release date, all the relevant open pull requests are reviewed and tested to make sure they're ready to be merged in the _develop_ branch, and a full regression test is run to reveal any bugs or regressions.
Once the full regression test passes, a release candidate is made available, shortly followed by the actual release (either on the planned release date, or shortly after it if necessary).
