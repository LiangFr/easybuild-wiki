To keep each other up-to-date with recent developments and ongoing efforts, we schedule an EasyBuild conference call regularly.

**Note: Since this process is still quite new to us, we're still discovering a setup that works out well. Hence, the below is subject to change.**

### Format

EasyBuild conference calls are intended to enable community members to **stay up-to-date with current and future development efforts** (who is working on what, what is the progress, etc.), both by HPC-UGent and others.

**Everybody is free to join in**, be it actively (speaking up, proposing agenda points, ...) or passively (just listening in with video/sound muted).

The conference calls are planned well ahead (see below), and are held **bi-weekly** (i.e., every other week).

The intention is to keep the calls **focused** and **fast-paced**, which is reflected in the fact that the **duration will be limited to 30 minutes**. The main **agenda points** will be available before the start of the meeting, with a small slot reserved for open questions/suggestions.

### Practical

The conference calls are done by means of a **Google Hangout**. We opted for this approach since hangouts are 100% free (as in beer), as opposed to Skype Premium which is required for group calls and screen sharing.

To be able to join the conference calls, you need to [**join the EasyBuild community on Google+**](https://plus.google.com/communities/103632287931200436158), which requires a Google+ account.

To join an EasyBuild conference call, **use the link in `Video calls in this community` box on the [EasyBuild community page](https://plus.google.com/communities/103632287931200436158)** shortly before the start of the conference call.

### Planning

EasyBuild conference calls are planned **every first and third Tuesday of the month, at 3pm CET**.

Google+ Hangout URIs will be provided shortly before the conference calls, both via the EasyBuild community on Google+ and via the EasyBuild mailing list.
