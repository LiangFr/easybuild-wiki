To keep each other up-to-date with recent developments and ongoing efforts, we schedule an EasyBuild conference call regularly.

**Note: Since this process is still quite new to us, we're still discovering a setup that works out well. Hence, the below is subject to change.**


### Planning

EasyBuild conference calls are planned **every first and third Tuesday of the month, at 3pm CET**.

The following conference calls are planned at:
 * _**Tuesday November 5th 2013, 3pm CET**_
 * Tuesday November 19th 2013, 2.30pm CET _(note: during SC13 in Denver, 7.30am local time)_

Google+ Hangout URIs will be provided shortly before the conference calls, both via the EasyBuild community on Google+ and via the EasyBuild mailing list.


### Practical

The conference calls are done by means of a **Google Hangout**. We opted for this approach since hangouts are 100% free, as opposed to Skype Premium which is required for group calls and screen sharing.

To be able to join the conference calls, you need to [**join the EasyBuild community on Google+**](https://plus.google.com/communities/103632287931200436158), which requires a (free) Google+ account.
