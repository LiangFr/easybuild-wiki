To keep each other up-to-date with recent developments and ongoing efforts, we schedule an EasyBuild conference call regularly.

**Note: Since this process is still quite new to us, we're still discovering a setup that works out well. Hence, the below is subject to change.**


### Planning

EasyBuild conference calls are planned **every first and third Tuesday of the month, at 3pm CET**.

The following conference calls is planned at: _**Tuesday November 5th 2013, 3pm CET**_.


### Practical

The conference calls are done by means of a **Google Hangout**. We opted for this approach since hangouts are 100% free,
as opposed to Skype Premium which is required for group calls and screen sharing.

FIXME: how do people participate exactly? outline this here
