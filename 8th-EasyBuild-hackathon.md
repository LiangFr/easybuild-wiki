## Topics

Attendees are free to work on what they want, but a couple of topics of interest are typically attached to each hackathon. The intention is to have discussions on these topics, and that some attendees work on these issues:

* improve integration between Lmod and EasyBuild (w/ Robert McLay, main Lmod developer)
* how we can further improve/automate testing of and contributing back to EasyBuild
