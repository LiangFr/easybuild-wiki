Contributions to EasyBuild, made via [pull requests](Contributing back), are thoroughly reviewed and evaluated before they are merged in to the `develop` branch, ready for being part of the next release of EasyBuild.

This process is important to **ensure stability of the `develop` branches, and high quality and timely releases**.

## Review process details

Reviews mainly consist of evaluating the technical aspect of contributions, which includes **functionality** (_what is being contributed?_) and **code** (_how was it implemented?_). Another aspect that is consider is **style** (_how does the code look?_).

The following specific attention points are taken into account when contributions are reviewed:

 * unit test suite
 * code style
 * testing result

Depending on the particular EasyBuild repository (framework, easyblocks or easyconfigs) to which the contribution is being made, there is a different focus on each of these.

### Unit test suite

For every pull request, our [Jenkins setup](https://jenkins1.ugent.be/view/EasyBuild)

### Code style

### Testing result
